# ESIP Discussion

ESIPs are proposals for improvement to the Ethscriptions protocol. Final and draft ESIPs live in [this repository](https://github.com/ethscriptions-protocol/Ethscriptions-Docs/tree/main/esips) which is [synced with this GitBook](https://docs.ethscriptions.com/esips/what-are-esips).

The repository you're in now hosts public discussions of current draft ESIPs as well as public proposals for new ESIPs.

[Create or add to an issue](https://github.com/ethscriptions-protocol/ESIP-Discussion/issues) to do these things!
